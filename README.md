Teleport
========

Teleport is all about getting around WordPress quickly! Use keyboard shortcuts to get where you need to go with just two key strokes.

The intuitive teleporter is arranged exactly like the keyboard shortcuts - the e, d, s, a, and q keys make a 'u' shape around the w key. This matches the layout of the teleporter.
